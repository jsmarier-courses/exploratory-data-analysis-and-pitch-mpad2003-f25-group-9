## Summary of our Analysis

We took a data set that separated Ottawa into each of the 24 wards and differentiated them on numerous different characteristics. We cleaned and broke down this data to single out the characteristics most suitable for a potential story idea, which we found income to be a good variable, as many factors can influence location by ward in relation to income. Overall, we found that the levels of income do not differ drastically by region, but there is a clear difference in the city centre compared to surrounding wards, and we found that we could use this data to tell a variety of stories including but not limited to cost of living, number of earning residents to a household, or different kinds of jobs in different geographical locations across Ottawa.
